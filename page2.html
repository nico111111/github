        Canny Apex Legends have figured out a way to get crafting materials from
        levelling up the Battle Pass instead of loot boxes: by pretending to be in
        Belgium, a country which has cracked down on loot boxes. This results in a
        slightly smaller overall reward but materials do let players craft specific
        skins rather than hoping for blind luck with the boxes. All you have to do
        is change the region in your Origin account settings, not any fiddly VPN
        shenanigans, which doesn’t affect where you can play either. I would not
        be too surprised to see EA try to block this trick.

        Apex Legends launched its Battle Pass yesterday. As is the battle royale
        way, buying the Pass gives players a digital doodad to level up by playing,
        unlocking bonus rewards along the way. The rewards for several levels are
        loot boxes of cosmetic doodads with fixed rarities but random rewards,
        so you might know you’ll get ‘legendary’ gear but have no idea what.
        Or that’s how it goes for most of the world.

        One Legger in Belgium noted on Reddit yesterday that rather than the
        expected loot boxes (containing random cosmetic doodads) along the
        progress track of their Battle Pass, they were to receive crafting
        materials in their place. Belgium has far stricter laws on loot boxes than
        most country (i.e. it has any laws on loot boxes) and EA have clashed with
        them before. EA recently caved to pressure (i.e. Belgium lawfolk repeating
        their stance that certain types of loot boxes are illegal gambling) and
        stopped selling FIFA Ultimate Team loot boxes in Belgium. I imagine we’re
        seeing something similar here.
